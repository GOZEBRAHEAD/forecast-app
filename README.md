# Forecast/Weather App

This app allows you to see the forecast for the next 5 days of any city around the world.
You can search by coords (latitude/longitude) or specific names.

Made with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and using BEM methodologies for CSS classes.

API used in this project:
```bash
https://www.metaweather.com/api/
```

To fix CORS problems, I've decide to use another important URL before the API URL:
```
https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=
```
